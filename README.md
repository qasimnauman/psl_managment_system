**Hey! Welcome to PSL Management System**

A system built to manage the bookings of tickets for PSL. This includes the following features:
  •	A user interface which allows user to create an account as well
  •	Effective management of pricing of tickets
  •	Effective management of booking of seats according to enclosure type and category
  •	Deletion of reservations already made

Implementing it as my semester project assigned in the first semester of Undergrad Degree in CS was a bit difficult but a fun and learning task.
